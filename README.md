# Pixer

You will need to create an APIKey.java file in the app/src/main/java/com/glakshya2/pixer. The file should have a getAPIKey() function that will return your API key as a string.

You can grab an free API Key from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
Make sure that the API key you generate has a "read" role.

Once installed, you only need to open the app once, it will run in the background after.

Steps to use:
When you have a picture on your screen, take a screenshot.
You will then get a notification.
Click on the notification and you will hear a description of the image on your screen
